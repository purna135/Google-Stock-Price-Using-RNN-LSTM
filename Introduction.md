# Welcome to 'Stock Price Prediction Using RNN Model' project

## Introduction:

### What is a STOCK ???
A **[Stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp)** is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "Shares".
**Hmmm...! So a Stock is basically an equity investment that represents part ownership in a corporation or a company.**

### What is Stock Market Prediction ?
**[Stock Market Prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_prediction#:~:text=Stock%20market%20prediction%20is%20the,price%20could%20yield%20significant%20profit.)** is the act of trying to determining the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.

Well! There is a lot of complicated **financial indicators [(Market Indicators)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market_indicators.asp#:~:text=Market%20indicators%20are%20quantitative%20in%20nature%20and%20seek%20to%20interpret,attempt%20to%20forecast%20market%20moves.&text=Popular%20market%20indicators%20include%20Market,%2DDecline%2C%20and%20Moving%20Averages.)** and also the fluctuation of the stock market is very violent. However as the technology is getting advanced the opportunity to gain a steady fortune from the stock market is increased and it also helps experts to find out the most informative indicators to make a better prediction.

_The prediction of the market value is of great importance to help you in maximizing the profit of your stock option purchase while keeping the risk low. And this is important because you need to invest your money in a stock which is going to increase in value over time and not decrease._

### What is RNN (or Recurrent Neural Network) ?
[A recurrent neural network (RNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.

_RNN has proven to be one the most powerful models for processing sequential data. [Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)_ _is one of the most successful RNN architectures. LSTM introduces the memory cell, a unit of computation, that replaces the traditional artificial neurons in the hidden layer of the network. With these memory cells, networks are able to effectively associate memories and input remote in time. Hence this suit to grasp the structure of the data dynamically overtime with high predictioin capacity._

**NOTE:- Must check the link to LSTM mentioned in above paragraph.**
